# Labyrinth_solver
To develop a robot using TIVA Launchpad and ultrasonic sensors  which can solve the labyrinth without any interruption. 
A labyrinth in general has a single, 
nonbranching path leading from the entrance to the exit. 
This is extended in real-life scenarios where pathfinding is a 
crucial task. A fully autonomous robot vehicle is designed to 
achieve it by avoiding the obstacles in front. The Tiva board 
(EK-TM4C123GXL) is the microcontroller platform 
employed and its software counterpart, Energia IDE was 
used. An ultrasonic sensor supported by a servo motor, 
yields in the detection of the obstacle in front allowing the 
robot to bypass the shorter distance. Depending on the input 
signal received, the microcontroller redirects the robot to 
move in the alternate direction by actuating the motors 
which are interfaced via the motor driver. An optical 
encoder is used, to monitor the rotary speed of the wheels. 
All of these integrated together serve the purpose of 
manoeuvring the labyrinth.
